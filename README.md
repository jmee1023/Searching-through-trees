# Searching-through-trees

For this project I performed a series of searches for 1000+ objects(Movie objects) stored in a Binary
Search Tree, an AVL Tree, and a Splay Tree. For each search, recorded how many objects
I had to visit to complete the search. I then analyzed the differences in a report that is attached to the repository
