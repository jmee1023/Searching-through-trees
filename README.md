# Searching-through-trees

For this project I performed a series of searches for 1000+ objects stored in a Binary Search Tree, an AVL Tree, and a Splay Tree. I performed these searches on three different sets of numbers : a sorted list in range [0, N-1]; a random ordering of the same integers; and a list of integers [0, N/5] that repeat each integer five times in a row (i.e. 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 etc.). I then analyzed the differences and graphed out my results in a report that is attached to the repository
